      <p class="description">
        Chicken piccata is an Italian-American dish made with lightly floured
        and pan-fried chicken cutlets served in a lemon-butter sauce with
        capers. It's known for its bright, tangy flavor and rich, buttery
        finish. The dish is typically made by sautéing chicken breasts in olive
        oil or butter, then deglazing the pan with white wine, lemon juice, and
        chicken broth. Capers are added for a briny contrast, and the sauce is
        finished with more butter for a silky texture. It’s often served with
        pasta, rice, or vegetables.
