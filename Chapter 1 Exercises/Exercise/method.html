        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Put a serving
          platter inside the preheating oven to heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Salt and pepper chicken breast portions before covering them with
          flour. Shake off excess flour. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet;
          pan-fry the chicken pieces until golden brown on both sides, about 3
          minutes per side. Perform the cooking task piece by piece while
          avoiding overcrowding the skillet by adding oil when necessary.
          Transfer ready chicken pieces onto the preheated platter that awaits
          in the oven. Drain most of the oil from the skillet until a thin
          surface coat remains after completing all chicken pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          By stirring minced garlic in the skillet for 20 seconds you will
          achieve its fragrant aroma. Drain the chicken broth into the skillet
          while you stir and remove all browned particles sitting on the bottom.
          The addition of lemon slices should be followed by boiling the
          mixture. Stir the mixture intermittently during 5 to 8 minutes of
          cooking to achieve a reduced amount of 2/3 cup sauce. The mixture
          requires five more minutes of simmer time while adding lemon juice and
          capers until the sauce becomes thickened and reduced. Add the butter
          to the skillet then tilt it while swishing the butter throughout the
          sauce. After introducing parsley you should remove the heat and let
          the mixture rest.

          Arrange chicken medallions on serving plates and spoon sauce over each
          portion to serve.
