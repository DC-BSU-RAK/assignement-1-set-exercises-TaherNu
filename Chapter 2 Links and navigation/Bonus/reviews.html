          <b>@EKKO GLAZER:</b> I have never been one to watch animated series,
          much less those based on video games. But when a friend relentlessly
          insisted that I give Arcane a chance, I finally gave in. Little did I
          know, I was about to make one of the best decisions of my life.

          <b>@MOMMY_MEL:</b> If you haven’t watched Arcane yet, what are you
          waiting for?! This Netflix series is a visual and emotional
          masterpiece that exceeds every expectation.

          <b>@LEAGUE ENJOYER:</b> I’ve played League of Legends a few times, but
          I was somewhat vague on the characters. I’ve never really watched
          anime before, but Arcane seriously surprised me.

          <b>@HAWKTUAH:</b> There are not enough words to encapsulate how
          spectacular this show is. The animation from the Fortiche team, is
          visually beautiful, with exceptional detail. Every action, gesture,
          touch, and expression has been so well animated and the level of
          detail can be picked apart for hours! The animation enables the viewer
          to feel a part of the world that League of Legends has crafted.

          <b>@dDSJGHF: </b>This show is very clearly a passion project. The art
          style and clever writing are truly inspiring. The character
          development, play with trauma - In a more realistic way- and well
          thought through reactions based on their background is truly
          impressive. This really came through with Jinx, and watching the slow
          death of powder made me so emotional. The character arcs
