        Arcane tells the story of two sisters, Vi and Jinx, who are torn apart
        by conflict in the divided cities of Piltover and Zaun. As Piltover
        thrives with the invention of Hextech, Zaun’s citizens turn to the
        dangerous drug Shimmer for power. While Vi fights for justice, Jinx
        descends into chaos, setting the stage for a war fueled by ambition,
        technology, and betrayal.

          <b>@VI LOVER:</b> I love it !!!!! Full stars well deserved !!! I beg
          beg and hope for more seasons arcane to come back ! It was a an
          AWESOME SHOW!!!! It was so breath taken. ! Words I can’t express! It
          was amazing !!!!! I’d really love to see more what happens next ! The
          show was so intense emotionally !!!

          <b>@EKKO GLAZER:</b> I have never been one to watch animated series,
          much less those based on video games. But when a friend relentlessly
          insisted that I give Arcane a chance, I finally gave in. Little did I
          know, I was about to make one of the best decisions of my life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>@MOMMY_MEL:</b> If you haven’t watched Arcane yet, what are you
          waiting for?! This Netflix series is a visual and emotional
          masterpiece that exceeds every expectation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>@LEAGUE ENJOYER:</b> I’ve played League of Legends a few times, but
          I was somewhat vague on the characters. I’ve never really watched
          anime before, but Arcane seriously surprised me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>@LOL TOUCHER:</b> As a person who does'n't play LoL, I used to
          watch my brothers play the game all the time purely because I was so
          fascinated by the lore. I was not a fan of the game but I am a fan of
          its universe. I would often think about how awesome it could be if
          they are to be adapted into an animated film or series. That's why I
          was so delighted when they announced Arcane out of the blue because
          finally, non-players like myself are able to enjoy the wonders
          Runeterra and the amazing collection of characters it has to offer.

          <b>@NO.1 GLAZER:</b> Absolute masterpiece. I have never played League
          of Legends, and from what I heard, it is a mediocre game, so I had
          some doubts about this show. But it took no time at all to get me
          hooked. The art is breathtaking with such definition and detail, it's
          not like anything I've ever seen. The animation is smooth and the
          characters move in a realistic way. The art of the backgrounds and
          landscapes is amazing and makes everything really come to life. The
          characters are well-thought out and not flat or stale; there is a lot
          of backstory and emotion in their words and actions, and nothing feels
          forced or unnatural. The world building is absolutely incredible as
          well; the creators perfectly introduced the plot and themes, and the
          side characters are so well fleshed out that they could be main
          characters. And, one of the biggest factors that makes this show
          perfect, is the cinematography. It is absolutely incredible,
          hands-down. The angles, the lighting, the sound affects, the
          transitions, it's perfect. The show also makes everything come
          together with the voice acting. The actors did amazing jobs bringing
          the characters to life and giving a intense emotional core. I can't
          count how many times I've been watching an episode and been struck
          with the emotional value and intensity of the scenes. I have been
          beside myself with sorrow, fear, excitement, anger, and happiness all
          form watching a scene in a television show. It is incredible how real
          and well-thought out Arcane is. The plot is immaculate and will never
          get boring; there is always something exciting and interesting going
          on. It is the pinnacle of video game adaptations , one of the
          greatest. In all honesty, it is the best show I've ever seen. Go watch
          it, you will not regret it.

          <b>@HAWKTUAH:</b> There are not enough words to encapsulate how
          spectacular this show is. The animation from the Fortiche team, is
          visually beautiful, with exceptional detail. Every action, gesture,
          touch, and expression has been so well animated and the level of
          detail can be picked apart for hours! The animation enables the viewer
          to feel a part of the world that League of Legends has crafted.

          <b>@I LOVE THIS GAME:</b> Wow. This series really felt like it was
          made out of combined effort of people who wanted to tell a story, make
          us fall in love with characters they wanted and were not forced by
          filthy corporate pulling strings and ruining organic ideas behind the
          scenes. Every character's arc felt fleshed out, every scene had it's
          stakes, there were no 2 dimensional characters and you could tell how
          each second of the series was done with love and care. I've never seen
          any series like this for years, the powerful storytelling, the vfx
          were top notch like people were really given time to work through out
          what suits the series best. The pacing was smooth and I truly love how
          diversified they kept the cast, showing powerful woman, poc and lgbt
          relationship without being forced down the user throat.

          <b>@dDSJGHF: </b>This show is very clearly a passion project. The art
          style and clever writing are truly inspiring. The character
          development, play with trauma - In a more realistic way- and well
          thought through reactions based on their background is truly
          impressive. This really came through with Jinx, and watching the slow
          death of powder made me so emotional. The character arcs
